Django-doc-helper
=================

A chrome extension to auto redirect to desired django docs version. We always use a single django version for all our projects which might not be up to date with the latest version. However, whenever you open a page from django doc(after a google search), you always end up in the development version of the document. You need to select appropriate version at the bottom. This extension will always take you to thr right version of the document based on your settings.
